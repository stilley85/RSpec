RSpec is made of 3 independant ruby gems:

rspec-core - the overall test harness.
rspec-expectations - provides readable, poweful syntax for checking properties of your code.
rspec-mocks - makes it easy to isolate code you are testing from the rest of the system.


Arrange/Act/Assert pattern - set up an object, do something with it, check it behaved the way wanted.

describe, it and expect - the core APIs of RSpec

RSpec hooks run automatically at specified times during testing
Helper methods - regular ruby methods, you control when these run
let construct initializes data on demand



Hooks

Will run automatically before each example. RSpec keeps track of all hooks you've registered.
When RSpec is about to start running an example it will run any before hooks that apply.
