RSpec is made of 3 independant ruby gems:

rspec-core - the overall test harness.
rspec-expectations - provides readable, poweful syntax for checking properties of your code.
rspec-mocks - makes it easy to isolate code you are testing from the rest of the system.


Arrange/Act/Assert pattern - set up an object, do something with it, check it behaved the way wanted.

describe, it and expect - the core APIs of RSpec
